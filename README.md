# ðŸ“˜ About the Project

**Inception-of-Things (IoT)** is a system administration project designed to introduce students to modern cloud-native infrastructure tools. It focuses on lightweight Kubernetes distributions such as **K3s** and **K3d**, virtual machine provisioning with **Vagrant**, and GitOps workflows using **Argo CD**.

The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience with:

- Setting up container-based infrastructure
- Managing Kubernetes clusters in resource-constrained environments
- Automating application deployment with Git-based workflows
- Understanding CI/CD principles using real-world tools

Through a series of structured parts, the project simulates realistic infrastructure deployment scenarios where students build and manage a fully functional Kubernetes-based environment using modern DevOps practices.
